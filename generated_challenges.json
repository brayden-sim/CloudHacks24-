[{"difficulty": "Easy", "type": "Coordinates", "text": "## Coding Challenge: Distance Between Points\n\n**Description:**\n\nYou are given two sets of coordinates representing two points on a 2D plane. Your task is to calculate the distance between these two points.\n\n**Sample Input:**\n\n```\n(1, 2)\n(4, 6)\n```\n\n**Sample Output:**\n\n```\n5.0\n```\n\n**Hints:**\n\n* Use the `math` module and its `sqrt()` function to calculate the square root.\n* Use the formula for calculating the distance between two points: `sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)`.\n\n\n**Note:** This challenge can be solved using basic arithmetic operations and the square root function. You will need to extract the coordinates from the input and use them in the distance formula."}]
