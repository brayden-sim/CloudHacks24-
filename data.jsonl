{"response": "What is the difference between deep copy and quiz copy?\n\nDeep copy involves creating a new object that is an independent copy of the original object. This means that any changes of the new object will not affect the original object. This is often used when you want to preserve the original object's integrity. Deep copy can be done manually or with the use of libraries such as JSON.\n\nShallow copy, on the other hand, involves creating an object identical to the original object, except that it can still be modified indirectly through the original object. This means that any changes made to the new object will be reflected on the original one of the reference types like a list or dictionary. Shallow copy can only be done in one step.\n\nSo, which copy type do you think of as a better approach to consider quiz situations in mind?"}
